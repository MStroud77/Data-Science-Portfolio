This can be useful when you are calculating metrics such as an average over a period of time or a running total. Unlike a `GROUP BY`, it does not group rows into a single row. In this workspace, you will learn:\n- How to define a window function that includes a set of rows \n- How to divide the set of rows included within a window function into partitions or frames\n- How to calculate moving averages and running totals.","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"fae23d02-6f0f-4043-a62e-44653b97cfe7","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"## Calculating row numbers\nThe example below uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to assign a row number to each row.
