These outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations and have a low probability of appearing in real-world data. Including them in your dataset can lead to inaccurate models and misleading test results.\n\nTo improve the quality of your data, you can detect and remove these outliers using the Isolation Forest method. The Isolation Forest algorithm is an effective tool for identifying anomalies in your data. By isolating outliers, you can ensure that your model is trained and tested on data that better represents real-world scenarios.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to using the Isolation Forest method for outlier detection and removal.","metadata":{},"id":"8417ac1e-70f9-4cb9-9615-06969f1dccd2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Load packages\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4173,"lastExecutedAt":1717438799296,"lastExecutedByKernel":"894cf695-0ced-4aa1-b06b-6e4b5f540756","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Load packages\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split"},"id":"ad6694a6-f064-44a1-aa77-57095fda33e5","cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Load data from the csv file\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"housing.csv\", index_col=False)\ndf.head()","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":53,"lastExecutedAt":1717438799351,"lastExecutedByKernel":"894cf695-0ced-4aa1-b06b-6e4b5f540756","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Load data from the csv file\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"housing.csv\", index_col=False)\ndf.head()"},"id":"50265658-3ac1-4075-bc11-46a313ddfa40","cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"CRIM","type":"number"},{"name":"ZN","type":"number"},{"name":"INDUS","type":"number"},{"name":"CHAS","type":"integer"},{"name":"NOX","type":"number"},{"name":"RM","type":"number"},{"name":"AGE","type":"number"},{"name":"DIS","type":"number"},{"name":"RAD","type":"integer"},{"name":"TAX","type":"number"},{"name":"PTRATIO","type":"number"},{"name":"LSTAT","type":"number"},{"name":"MEDV","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"CRIM":[0.00632,0.02731,0.02729,0.03237,0.06905],"ZN":[18,0,0,0,0],"INDUS":[2.31,7.07,7.07,2.18,2.18],"CHAS":[0,0,0,0,0],"NOX":[0.538,0.469,0.469,0.458,0.458],"RM":[6.575,6.421,7.185,6.998,7.147],"AGE":[65.2,78.9,61.1,45.8,54.2],"DIS":[4.09,4.9671,4.9671,6.0622,6.0622],"RAD":[1,2,2,3,3],"TAX":[296,242,242,222,222],"PTRATIO":[15.3,17.8,17.8,18.7,18.7],"LSTAT":[4.98,9.14,4.03,2.94,5.33],"MEDV":[24,21.6,34.7,33.4,36.2]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"      CRIM    ZN  INDUS  CHAS    NOX  ...
